# break-foundry
System that will allow you to play BREAK!! in FoundryVTT! This isn't a replacement for the source material, you're still going to need to buy the BREAK!! module in order to use this as the system only provides the framework to play the game.

## Documentation

For questions regarding the architecture and how things work in the template to begin coding, you can refer to this.
